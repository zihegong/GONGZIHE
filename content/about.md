<div class="about-copy">

I am a product designer with a broad practice spanning homewares, accessories, and textile-based products, working across concept development, product systems, and production-ready design.

My experience covers the full design spectrum, from early-stage ideation and design direction to cross-functional collaboration, supplier communication, and market-ready execution. I have led and contributed to the successful design and launch of hundreds of products that have reached consumers through real commercial channels.

Alongside hands-on design work, I have experience guiding product vision, coordinating teams, and balancing creative intent with feasibility, cost, and timelines. This dual perspective allows me to operate both as a designer and as a design lead within complex product environments.

My current interest lies in shaping contemporary lifestyle experiences for people and their pets, exploring how thoughtful design can create more pleasurable, emotionally resonant everyday moments through objects, materials, and systems.
